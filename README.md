# Docker Squid Proxy

This is an Squid-Proxy that acts as a 'transparent-proxy' to accelerate the docker-image reconstruction.

This solution is based on [squid-in-a-can](https://github.com/jpetazzo/squid-in-a-can) project, developed by &copy;[Jérôme Petazzoni](https://github.com/jpetazzo).

### Requirements
* `docker-engine` >= 1.12
* `docker-compose` >= 1.8.1
* `docker run` need `--privileged` and `--network host` flag.

---

### Limitations
* Can't handle [HTTPS](http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/HTTPS) for now.

### How-to

#### Manually (with `docker run`)

You can manually run these commands:

```bash
docker run -d --privileged --network host intraway/squid-proxy
```

#### Run via docker-compose

There is a `docker-compose.yml` file to enable launching via [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
To use this you will need a local checkout of this repo and have `docker` and `compose` installed.

> Run the following command in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
 docker-compose up
```

You can customize the `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '2'

volumes:
  squid_cache:

services:
  squid-proxy:
    image: intraway/squid-proxy
    hostname: squid-proxy
    container_name: squid-proxy
    network_mode: host
    privileged: true
    volumes:
      - squid_cache:/var/cache/squid
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime
    environment:
      - SQUID_LISTEN_PORT=3128
      - SQUID_MAX_CACHE_SIZE=5000
      - SQUID_MAX_CACHE_OBJECT=1024
```

#### Tuning

The docker image can be tuned using environment variables.

###### SQUID_LISTEN_PORT
Squid listening port. Use the `-e SQUID_LISTEN_PORT=1024` to set the listening port.

###### SQUID_MAX_CACHE_OBJECT
Squid has a maximum object cache size. Often when caching debian packages vs standard web content it is valuable to increase this size. Use the `-e SQUID_MAX_CACHE_OBJECT=1024` to set the max object size (in MB).

###### SQUID_MAX_CACHE_SIZE
The squid disk cache size can be tuned. Use `-e SQUID_MAX_CACHE_SIZE=5000` to set the disk cache size (in MB).

### To-Do
* To handle [HTTPS](http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/HTTPS) requests with custom trusted certificates.
